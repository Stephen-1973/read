          Why do we need an Action Plan
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is to build an insanely huge app using TypeScript NodeJs, MongoDB, Nats Streaming Server and Next Js
          for server side rendering. Next Js is exactly the same as react Js. Next Js is only better because it provides
          better API interaction and server side rendering which microservice app need. <strong>
            You can learn Next Js in 2 Mins.
          </strong>
          That's right 2 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>Search for Next Js Blog Course in this website. The read time is less than 2 minutes and you can master
          server side rendering react Js Framework in matter of seconds.</p>
        <p>
          Typescript is also no different than Javascript. I know there 10 - 20 hrs of courses on learning Typescript
          but they are useless. They won't teach you anything related to what we are gonna build. We will learn
          Typescript as we build our app. It's gonna be easy. Trust me.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I mentioned in the docker blog we are gonna build our first app without kubernetes or docker. So we know
          the difference and grasp a better idea around docker, kubernetes and skaffold. If I directly jump into
          building microservice web apps with Kubernetes you guys are gonna be lost and will definitely hate me for it.
        </p>
        <p>I don't want anyone to think that microservice apps are hard to build. Kubernetes + Microservices web apps
          are future. In future no ones gonna build a website without using kubernetes. <strong>So you must be ready for
            the
            change</strong>.</p>

          Most of you might know how to create a post and comment app like Instagram. But I bet you don't know how to
          create one with react frontend and Node Js. For this project we are not gonna use any database like SQL or
          MongoDB. We are gonna store the data in the Backend Api itself. Building a Microservices app with MongoDB,
          Typescript and Next Js requires a lot of knowledge. We need to understand the architecture of Microservices
          app first and for it to be possible I can't be using all 1st class stuff like Next Js, MongoDB to build as our
          first app. It's too heavy for you. That's the reason we will be going step by step.
        </p>
        <h2>Skills you will learn.</h2>
        <p>These are the following skills which you will be learning by building our first app.</p>
        <p><strong>Custom Event Bus</strong> - An event bus is a Api that allows our different Api's to interact without
          one Api directly
          interacting with other.If an API to directly communicate with other API then it will cause a lot of
          miscommunication. Why? Let's say you are working in amazon and suddenly a Node Cluster went offline because it
          couldn't handle so many requests. This often happens a lot in big tech companies that's the reason there are
          <strong>'Stand By Nodes'.</strong> Now an API directly interacting with the API that just went down. Imagine
          the problems it could cause. The API which is directly interacting with the other API will also go down
          because it couldn't interact with the API and then many others API's which interact with these API's will go
          down and finally the whole website will be down. You can prevent this by writing an on catch error. But is
          that really enough though ? No Not at all. It's not enough. Communication between API's in microservices app
          is such a huge problem that Google had to invent NATS Streaming Server. We will learning that in our 2nd app.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Backend Architecture</strong> - In a microservice app architecture is everything. Imagine you are
          working for a Bank that needs Backend API for Net Banking. If you don't use the infamous architecture for it
          and just use reading and writing Bank Balance for each customer using Database, you would be in big trouble.
          Because Database aren't know for their availability. In a huge application clusters go down frequently and if
          you can't write the deposited amount into the storage before the certain customer withdraw's then his money is
          gone. Let's talk about a better example. A customer's bank account has been deposited money worth of a Million
          Dollars and as soon as it's deposited the customer wants to withdraw it and at the crucial moment our database
          got too many requests and has insane latency. Once our API sends the request to the Database we update our
          client
          whoever deposited the money as the money has been deposited but the customer when tries withdraw since our
          Database has latency and can't update his amount then he won't be able to withdraw the money. Imagine how many
          complaints would be filing up against the bank. <strong>Insane right ?</strong> how a small mistake could
          damage the reputation of the bank.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>FrontEnd and BackEnd Communication</strong> - Many people who have experience in the field of Front
          End don't know how to deal with the communication with Backend and few don't know how to dynamically render
          the data from API in the Front End. This will be the core of learning concept for this app.
        </p>
        <p>For the next app we are gonna build we are gonna learn to write <strong>Skaffold Files</strong>, <strong>Nats
            Streaming Server</strong> and
          <strong>MongoDB</strong>
