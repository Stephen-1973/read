                <p class=about_docker-p-1>
                    We all heard about Docker somewhere in our lifes as programmers. But what is Docker exactly. Why has
                    it become so essential for microservice web apps. If you never about Docker in your lifes, just the
                    name then you will need work a bit hard as your life as programmer. Read various kinds of blogs and
                    subscribe to Google Cloud Platform youtube channels on the internet and also follow my blog.
                </p>
                <p class='about_docker-p-2'>
                    <strong>Don't freak out !!!!!!</strong> As I said if you never about Docker then you will need work
                    hard that doesn't mean you will be left in dust. You, in a few seconds are gonna know what exactly
                    docker is.
                </p>
                <p class='about_docker-p-2'>Definition: Docker is first of all an open source software that
                    allows
                    developers to containerize
                    their large apps into tiny containers. Didn't understand ?
                    Well, let's look at an example.
                    <strong>Take amazon for example all it's web pages are dynamically rendered
                        and available to users in matter of milliseconds </strong>. Surely there is no computer that
                    servers front
                    end
                    and back end that fast to billions of users who visit it every day right ? Well docker
                    solves this
                    issue.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>How ?</strong>
                    <br>
                    As I said it allows developers to convert their large apps into tiny containers. So if amazon has 10
                    Node Js backedn servers running then docker makes it possible for the application to run on 10
                    different containers while being on the same domain name. Each Node Js application is ran in
                    one different container with it's own
                    dependencies. So that way each container can be ran on different Virtual CPU. Just google how many
                    servers amazon uses.
                    <br>
                    I have seen many people confuse this with
                    the API's running on different computers with unique domain names. In Docker all the 10 API are ran
                    in different container while being part of the same app. So it's basically dividing an app into ten
                    pieces while all the pieces functioning as a unit. This is different from when you run API on
                    different computers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>You will get a clear idea on this once we build our own Docker Node JS app.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That's right around <strong>454,400 servers.</strong> That's why their web page is loaded in matter
                    of milliseconds
                    even though it's requested y thousands of people every second.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you didn't know about Docker this should have been an interesting read. Now enough theory let's
                    download Docker.

                    Email and password. Remember this before you create your docker account. You will be using Docker a
                    lot from here on out. So choose a password and ID which you can remember easily and type quickly.

                    <p>If you are done with your installation and signed into your docker account from the app then you

                    <p>Open up your Command Prompt, Terminal or Command Line and type "docker" and press enter.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If it said anything other than 'docker command not found' then docker has been installed on your

                    <p>You can check all the docker cli command appeared on your terminal when your typed 'docker' into
                        it.</p>
                    <p>We will be using a lot of docker cli command for our first project. From the Microservices series
                        we will automating docker and kubernetes with Skaffold so that you don't have to get your hands
                        dirty with typing docker commands every single time you change your application.</p>

                        Are you all excited to build an Social Media Clone like Instagram or Facebook or more so exactly
                        like Instagram and Facebook.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We will be building a lot of cool apps even including apps which use Machine Learning and the
                        cool part is we are gonna use an API we ourselves are gonna build the Machine Learning API.If
                        you are not interested in Machine Learning, No Problemo, We will still build a lot of real world
                        apps like Whatsapp, Facebook and Instagram with Node Js and deploy them to kubernetes cluster on
                        digital Ocean. More details later.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Make sure to follow the blog series regularly and build the apps with me and don't ever forget to
                        push those apps to your github repo's. This will be greatly enhance your portfolio and seperate
                        you from rest.</p>
