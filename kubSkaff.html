                <p>
                    Unlike in our Docker blog there are no tons of paragraphs to know about Kubernetes. Kubernetes
                    simply exists to make it easier to organise developers application across a different number of
                    computers. In Kubernetes Cluster we refer to these computers as <strong>Nodes.</strong> Each Node
                    contains number of virtual machines which and each virtual machine has on an average of 4 - 6 vCPU's
                    (Virtual CPU). Each VM has it's own vCPU's and memory.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So as we discussed in Docker Blog each container is pushed into these Nodes. I think now you have a
                    clear understanding of how this works. If you did Great ! It's fine even if you didn't understand it
                    at all. We are gonna talk about all these a lot in future blogs. I mean we just started right. There
                    is a long way to go and lot to learn.
                </p>

                    About Skaffold
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now this is important. Even though I mentioned that kubernetes eases the process of running
                    application on different Nodes, it's still a nightmare to take care of it. Many developers choose to
                    avoid and just deploy their application without kubernetes. That's where Skaffold comes in. Once you
                    deploy your application to Kubernetes Cluster via Github Pull Request you don't need to use any
                    commands to get it up and running on the cluster. Skaffold files takes care of that and it's easy to
                    write Skaffold
                    (.yaml)
                    files too. Just do the hard stuff once before deployment and the next time revise your application
                    how many ever times without issuing a single command ever again. That's the power of Skaffold.

                        Now for those of you who read my docker blog. You can run kubernetes on your local system with
                        just 2 steps.
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    For those of you who didn't read my docker blog yet. I recommend to install and set up docker on
                    your system. You can check my docker blog if you have any doubts.
                    <br>
                    Open up your docker desktop application,
                    >>> Click on the settings logo you see on the top right hand side.
                    <br>
                    >>> Click on the kubernetes options appeared on the left side of your screen.
                    <br>
                    >>> Now enable Kubernetes. That's all.

                    For Skaffold the following.
                    <br>
                    Paste the following command in your terminals according to your system requirements mentioned.

                That's all for now folks. I pretty much think you shouldn't have faced any error. Skaffold maintains
                itself
                so
                uniquely that almost no one has ever had installation error.
